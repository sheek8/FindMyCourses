Find My Courses is a website designed by a group of Berkeley students to make it convenient for students to choose their courses by easily accessing up-to-date information and anonymous student feedback. The website provides a platform for students to read and submit reviews on courses they have taken, including information such as workload, difficulty, professor quality, and overall experience.

By creating an account, students can save and track their favorite courses, as well as receive notifications when new reviews are added for those courses. The website also includes a search function, allowing students to find courses by department, course number, or keywords.
